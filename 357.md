# 357. Count Numbers with Unique Digits

## Intro

Given a **non-negative** integer n, count all numbers with unique digits, x, where 0 ≤ x < 10^n.

#### Example

Given n = 2, return 91. (The answer should be the total numbers in the range of 0 ≤ x < 100, excluding `[11,22,33,44,55,66,77,88,99]`)

#### Hint

1. A direct way is to use the backtracking approach.
2. Backtracking should contains three states which are (the current number, number of steps to get that number and a bitmask which represent which number is marked as visited so far in the current number). Start with state (0,0,0) and count all valid number till we reach number of steps equals to 10n.
3. This problem can also be solved using a dynamic programming approach and some knowledge of combinatorics.
4. Let f(k) = count of numbers with unique digits with length equals k.
5. f(1) = 10, ..., f(k) = 9 * 9 * 8 * ... (9 - k + 2) [The first factor is 9 because a number cannot start with 0].

## Think

又是一道偏向数学的题目，其实就是求几个数字不重复的排列组合。当位数为k时，k位数中，各个位数字不重复的组合有f(k) = 9 * 9 * 8 * ... (9 - k + 2)种。那么思路就很清晰了。用一个数一直记录前k-1位时不重复的个数，再加上f(k)就是k位不重复的数字个数。

## Solution

Python
 
```python
class Solution(object):
    def countNumbersWithUniqueDigits(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        pre = 1
        ret = 0
        acc = 1
        if n == 0:return 1
        for i in xrange(n):
            if i == 0:
                acc *= 9
                ret = pre + acc
                pre = ret
                continue
            acc *= (10 - i)
            pre = ret
            ret = acc + pre
        return ret
```
