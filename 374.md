# 374. Guess Number Higher or Lower

## Intro

We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number is higher or lower.

You call a pre-defined API `guess(int num)` which returns 3 possible results (-1, 1, or 0):

```
-1 : My number is lower
 1 : My number is higher
 0 : Congrats! You got it!
```

#### Example

```
n = 10, I pick 6.

Return 6.
```

## Thinking

其实就是二分查找，找出要猜的数。管家这里有个陷阱，就是他的guess API。My number 其实说的是它的数， 而不是我们输入的数。也就是说，如果我输入的数比它大，它返回-1.

## Solution


Python

```python
# The guess API is already defined for you.
# @param num, your guess
# @return -1 if my number is lower, 1 if my number is higher, otherwise return 0
# def guess(num):

class Solution(object):
    def guessNumber(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        start = 1
        end = n
        while start <= end:
            mid = (start + end) / 2
            g = guess(mid)
            if g == 0:
                return mid
            elif g < 0:
                end = mid - 1
            else:
                start = mid + 1
```
