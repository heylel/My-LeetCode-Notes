# 202. Happy Number

## Intro

Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".

A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

**Example**: 19 is a happy number

```
1² + 9² = 82
8² + 2² = 68
6² + 8² = 100
1² + 0² + 0² = 1
```

## Thinking

这次只能用笨的方法，还没什么捷径，唯一的方法就是循环计算，将结果加到一个列表里，每次判断计算得到的数是否在列表里。

## Solution

Python

```python
class Solution(object):
    def isHappy(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: bool
        """
        nums = []
        while int(n) != 1:
            n = str(n)
            tmp = 0
            for i in range(len(n)):
                tmp += int(n[i]) ** 2
            if tmp in nums:
                return False
            nums.append(tmp)
            n = tmp
    
        return True
```
