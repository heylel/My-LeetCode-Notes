# 189. Rotate Array

## Intro

Rotate an array of *n* elements to the right by *k* steps.

For example, with *n* = 7 and *k* = 3, the array `[1,2,3,4,5,6,7]` is rotated to `[5,6,7,1,2,3,4]`.

#### Note

Try to come up as many solutions as you can, there are at least 3 different ways to solve this problem.


## Think

有点像将list首尾链接，拼接成循环list，然后在向右偏移k，也就是向左偏移len(nums) - k。之前一直卡在 `Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.`原来是多写了`return`.

## Solution

Python
 
```python
class Solution(object):
    def rotate(self, nums, k):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type k: int
        :rtype: void Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        k = k % len(nums)
        nums[:] = nums[-k:] + nums[:-k]
```
